# Urban Grammar in the Turing Cath Up

Last month, on November 23rd, Dani gave a quick overview of the Urban Grammar project at the monthly catch up of the Alan Turing Institute. This is an internal call open to all fellows and staff. Dani gave an overview of the project, and covered in a bit more detail the aspects that have been completed already, including the development of a Spatial Signature classification for Great Britain.

There is no video of the talk, but you can check out the slides used [here](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/202111_ati/) in the talks page of the project or, if you prefer to download a PDF version, you can do so [here](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/202111_ati/index.pdf).
