# British Spatial Signatures talk at CASA

On Monday November 29th, Dani gave a talk on the Spatial Signatures project at the [CASA](https://ucl.ac.uk/barlett/casa) seminars. The talk covered known bits from [previous talks](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks), mostly about framing of the problem and the foundational blocks of the Spatial Signatures but, more importantly, presented for the first time our results from the British signatures. The audience was engaging and had many super interesting questions. Thanks!

CASA recorded and published the video on YouTube:
