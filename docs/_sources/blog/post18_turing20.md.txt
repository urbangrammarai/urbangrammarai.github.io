# British Spatial Signatures at Towards urban analytics 2.0

On Tuesday, November 30th, Martin gave a lighting talk on the Spatial Signatures of Great Britain at the Alan Turing Insititute event [Towards urban analytics 2.0](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/towards-urban-analytics-20) that was in person in Leeds, UK. The talk introduced the classification of Great Britain that is now available in the form of [an interactive map](http://urbangrammarai.xyz/great-britain/#) and for download either from the [Consumer Data Research Centre's open data portal](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/spatial-signatures-great-britain) or the archived version from [figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.16691575.v1). While there was no space for a Q&A directly after the talk, it has raised an interest leading to several great informal discussions afterwards.

The slides from the talk are [here](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/202111_ati_leeds/index.html) or [here is the `PDF` file](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/202111_ati_leeds/index.pdf).
