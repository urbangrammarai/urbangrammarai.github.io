# Fourth Advisory Board

On March 17th 2022, the (hopefully) last online Advisory Board meeting was held over
Zoom. The assumption is that the final one in June will happen as an in-person meeting
in Liverpool.

It was the first meeting when the discussion could focus on the third WP dealing with
developing an AI model to detect signatures from satellite imagery. However, AI was not
the only point of discussion as we covered an overview of the current progress on the
publications, open data, dissemination, and future plans for an impact strategy. The
final section of the meeting was dedicated to the remaining time on the project and
tried to answer the question, "what should be done by the end of the year?".

We enjoyed a fruitful discussion and are looking forward to meeting all board members in
Liverpool soon.
