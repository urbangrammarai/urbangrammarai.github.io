- Co-delivered the talk "State of GeoPandas", together with Joris Van den Bossche (slides available [here](https://jorisvandenbossche.github.io/talks/2022_GeoPython_geopandas))
- Co-delivered with Joris Van den Bossche the workshop "Scaling up vector analysis with Dask-Geopandas (materials available in this [repo](https://github.com/martinfleis/dask-geopandas-tutorial))
