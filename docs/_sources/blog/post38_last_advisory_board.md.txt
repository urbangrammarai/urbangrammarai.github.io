# Fifth Advisory Board

On June 13th and 14th 2022, we held the last advisory board, but also the first one in person.
For two days, Martin and Dani welcomed Alistair Edwardes (DEFRA) and Miguel Monteiry (INPE in Brazil)
to discuss progress and next steps for the project. We missed Rachel Franklin (Newcastle/Turing), who
managed to join remotely for one of the work sessions, and Isabel Sargent (Ordnance Survey). All
in all, it was a productive visit that we hope will translate in further future collaboration and
joint ventures with members of the board.
