# Participation in JRC webinar

On April 20th, Dani participated on a [webinar](https://www.rsaeurope.org/event/jrc-webinar-series-future-of-cities) organised by the Joint Research Centre and the Regional Studies association. The event was held on the occassion of the launch of a [policy brief on the Future of Cities](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC116711) and focused on urban-rural interactions. Dani discussed the relevance of measuring the "urban" and the "rural" correctly, providing the Urban Grammar as an illustration. You can check out the slides he used in the [talks page](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/), both in [HTML](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/20230420_jrc/index.html) and [PDF](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/20230420_jrc/index.html) format.
