# Spatial Signatures at the Spatial Analytics + Data Seminar Series

On March 30th, Martin presented the current progress in the development
of Spatial Signatures at the Spatial Analytics + Data Seminar Series
organised by the University of Newcastle, the University of Bristol and
the Alan Turing Institute. Martin presented the basics of urban morphometrics,
showing examples of relevant research based on the `momepy` Python package to
provide a background for the second part of the talk focusing on Spatial
Signatures. The research was well received and initiated a great discussion,
which we hope will continue on some other platforms soon.

The recording is available on Youtube:
