# Capsules

> *"More than a blog post, less than anything else"*

Capsules are explorations of how the data products generated by the Urban Grammar are useful in a variety of contexts. They are data-driven narratives, presented in as close to fully reproducible way as possible and, as the name suggest, *encapsulated* in their own repository so they are portable. You can find here a list to available ones:

- [Age capsule](https://github.com/urbangrammarai/age_capsule): Spatial Signatures and building age 
- [Green belts](https://github.com/urbangrammarai/green_belts_capsule): what signatures make up green belts?
