<p>On December 9th. 2021, we held the meeting of the Advisory Board for the project. Still being limited by the global pandemic, we had a frutiful Zoom call filled with an exciting discussion on the opportunities Spatial Signatures offer.</p>
<p>The session started with an overview of the current progress focusing on the current progress and explanation of the whole process of generating spatial signatures from data acquistion to empirical exploration. We then spent
some time discussed the open infrastruture built around the project resulting in an open data product and maximum transparency of the process behind it. We followed by the focused discussion on dissemination and impact of the classification.</p>
<p>Three hours later, we finished with a lot of ideas and potential research avenues and collaborations to be explored. We hope that the situation permits another Advisory board meeting soon and hopefully, in person.</p>

<p><em>Within the project, we often need to map the results within different contexts ranging from static to interactive maps. We felt that it could be a smoother experience and built <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">xyzservices</span></code>.</em></p>
<p>A Python ecosystem offers numerous tools for the visualisation of data
on a map. A lot of them depend on XYZ tiles, providing a base map layer,
either from OpenStreetMap, satellite or other sources. The issue is that
each package that offers XYZ support manages its own list of supported
providers.</p>
<p>We have built <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">xyzservices</span></code> package to support any Python library making
use of XYZ tiles. I’ll try to explain the rationale why we did that,
without going into the details of the package. If you want those
details, check its <a class="reference external" href="https://xyzservices.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation</a>.</p>

<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">contextily</span></code> brings contextual base maps to static <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">geopandas</span></code> plots. It
comes with a dedicated <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">contextily.providers</span></code> module, which contains <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/geopandas/contextily/blob/v1.1.0/contextily/_providers.py">a

<p>Members of the Urban Grammar project are getting involved in developing the next
generation set of tools for distributing processing of geospatial vector data. In its
<a class="reference external" href="https://urbangrammarai.xyz/data_processing/index">first</a>
<a class="reference external" href="https://urbangrammarai.xyz/spatial_signatures/index">part</a>, the Urban Grammar
project heavily depends on the processing of vector geospatial data using
<a class="reference external" href="https://geopandas.org">GeoPandas</a> Python library. However, to scale GeoPandas
algorithms to the extent of Great Britain, we need to do more than the library can do by
default. GeoPandas operations are currently all single-threaded, severely limiting the
scalability of its usage and leaving most of the CPU cores just laying around, doing
nothing. <a class="reference external" href="https://dask.org/">Dask</a> is a library that brings parallel and distributed
computing to the ecosystem. For example, it provides a Dask DataFrame that consists of
partitioned pandas DataFrames. Each partition can be processed by a different process
enabling the computation to be done in parallel or even out-of-core.</p>
<p>We are using Dask within our workflows in bespoke scripts. However, Dask could provide
ways to scale geospatial operations in GeoPandas in a similar way it does with pandas.
There has been some effort to build a bridge between Dask and GeoPandas, currently
taking the shape of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/geopandas/dask-geopandas">dask-geopandas</a>
library. While that already supports basic parallelisation, which we used in our code,
some critical components are not ready yet. That should change during this summer within
the Google Summer of Code project Martin is (co-)mentoring. We hope that this effort
will allow us to significantly simplify and even speed up the custom machinery we built
to create spatial signatures in

We followed by the focused discussion on the concepts of Spatial Signature and Enclosed Tessellation and our initial paper illustrating both on the sample of cities worldwide. We discussed the clarity of our ideas and the needs for new spatial units and classification methods, and their potential drawbacks and enhancements. In the last part, we tried to zoom out to see a bigger picture and fit the research within existing projects within academia and the public sector.</p>
<p>After three hours of a very fruitful discussion, we finished with a lot of food for thought and ideas to be explored in the future. Let’s just hope that the Advisory Board meetings will soon happen physically in Liverpool to have an even more productive and friendly environment!</p>

<p>In this post, we introduce a new Python package to generate clustergrams from clustering solutions. The library has been developed as part of the Urban Grammar project, and it is compatible with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scikit-learn</span></code> and GPU-enabled libraries such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cuML</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cuDF</span></code> within <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RAPIDS.AI</span></code>.</p>
<p>When we want to do some cluster analysis to identify groups in our data, we often use algorithms like K-Means, which require the specification of a number of clusters. But the issue is that we usually don’t know how many clusters there are.</p>
<p>There are many methods on how to determine the correct number, like silhouettes or elbow plot, to name a few. But they usually don’t give much insight into what is happening between different options, so the numbers are a bit abstract.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.schonlau.net/clustergram.html">Matthias Schonlau</a> proposed another approach - a clustergram. Clustergram is a two-dimensional plot capturing the flows of observations between classes as you add more clusters. It tells you how your data reshuffles and how good your splits are. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.r-statistics.com/2010/06/clustergram-visualization-and-diagnostics-for-cluster-analysis-r-code/">Tal Galili</a> later implemented clustergram for K-Means in R. And I have used Tal’s
implementation, ported it to Python and created <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clustergram</span></code> - a Python package to make clustergrams.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clustergram</span></code> currently supports K-Means and using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scikit-learn</span></code> (inlcuding Mini-Batch implementation) and RAPIDS.AI <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cuML</span></code> (if you have a CUDA-enabled GPU), Gaussian Mixture Model (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scikit-learn</span></code> only) and hierarchical clustering based on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scipy.hierarchy</span></code>. Alternatively, we can create clustergram based on labels and data derived from alternative custom clustering algorithms. It provides a sklearn-like API and plots clustergram using matplotlib, which gives it a wide range of styling

<p>On March 30th, Martin presented the current progress in the development
of Spatial Signatures at the Spatial Analytics + Data Seminar Series
organised by the University of Newcastle, the University of Bristol and
the Alan Turing Institute. Martin presented the basics of urban morphometrics,
showing examples of relevant research based on the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">momepy</span></code> Python package to
provide a background for the second part of the talk focusing on Spatial
Signatures. The research was well received and initiated a great discussion,
which we hope will continue on some other platforms soon.</p>
<p>The recording is available on Youtube:</p>

<p>On March 16th, Dani presented ongoing work on the development of Spatial
Signatures at the University of Glasgow’s Urban Big Data Centre webinar
series. This was the first time we took the project on tour and it was very
well received. With an audience that peaked at about 75 folks and many great
questions that extended the session well over one hour, we are super happy
with how the foundational ideas of the project were received.</p>

<p>Any work of the size of our Urban Grammar AI project has many outputs. All of them should ideally share the same design language, so once we combine them, they tell a coherent story. Therefore, we have defined a visual style applied to any graphical output we will produce.</p>
<p>We have started with a basic colourmap. A significant part of our work will result in categorical maps, so we need diverse colours. We have looked back at the excellent cartography our predecessors produced and found a gem. A study of wage and nationality in Chicago by Jane Addams and Florence Kelley from 1895 resulted in a series of beautiful maps like this one:</p>
<p><em>Hull House Maps and Papers (1895) by Jane Addams and Florence Kelley.</em></p>
<p>We based our primary colours on the six colours you can see on this map. This colour map offers a variety while retaining readability, colours nicely play with each other and, importantly, are colour blind safe.</p>

<p>Have you ever needed to link two sources of data, each attached to a different geometry? In our work in the <a class="reference external" href="https://urbangrammarai.github.io/spatial_signatures/index">WP2</a>, we do. We have to transfer data from various sources, linked to output areas, urban blocks or other spatial units to our own bespoke set of geographies. Therefore, we often need to do areal interpolation to correctly map data from one layer to another. Luckily, the open-source Python ecosystem can help.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://pysal.org/tobler/">Tobler</a>, a part of <a class="reference external" href="https://pysal.org">PySAL family</a>, is a library for areal interpolation and dasymetric mapping which already offered what we needed. However, our data tends to be large, up to 15 million rows on which we need to interpolate several hundreds of thousands of rows of input data. That can take a while, so each performance improvement can help a lot.</p>
<p>We have looked into the existing code of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tobler</span></code> and contributed to the refactoring if its <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">area_interpolate</span></code> function. The original implementation was using custom code for spatial indexing, which was replaced by a performant vectorised implementation based on the more recent <a class="reference external" href="https://pygeos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pygeos</span></code></a> project.</p>
<p>With sample data, we’ve been able to speed up the interpolation from 2.4 seconds to less than 400 milliseconds, having the same result 6x faster.</p>
<p>Such an improvement is great, but it still uses only a single core (as most of the geospatial code to be honest), leaving the rest in a modern computer (four or more cores is not uncommon these days…) lazily laying around. We have tried to change this and contributed a (still experimental) parallel implementation of the same algorithm (based on <a class="reference external" href="https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">joblib</span></code></a>).</p>
