<p>We know little about how the way we organise cities over space influences social, economic and environmental outcomes, in part because it is hard to measure.</p>
<p>Satellite imagery, combined with cutting-edge AI, can provide a source of data to track the evolution of the built environment at unprecedented detail.</p>
<p>This project develops a conceptual framework to characterise urban structure through the notions of spatial signatures and urban grammar, and will deploy it to generate open data products and insight about the evolution of cities.</p>

<li><p>16 February - <a class="reference internal" href="blog/post6_tobler.html">Contribution to tobler: Speeding up areal interpolation</a></p>
<p>Have you ever needed to link two sources of data, each attached to a different geometry? In our work in the <a class="reference external" href="https://urbangrammarai.github.io/spatial_signatures/index">WP2</a>, we do. We have to transfer data from various sources, linked to output areas, urban blocks or other spatial units to our own bespoke set of geographies. Therefore, we often need to do areal interpolation to correctly map data from one layer to another. Luckily, the open-source Python ecosystem can help.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://pysal.org/tobler/">Tobler</a>, a part of <a class="reference external" href="https://pysal.org">PySAL family</a>, is a library for areal interpolation and dasymetric mapping which already offered what we needed. However, our data tends to be large, up to 15 million rows on which we need to interpolate several hundreds of thousands of rows of input data. That can take a while, so each performance improvement can help a lot.</p>
<p>We have looked into the existing code of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tobler</span></code> and contributed to the refactoring if its <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">area_interpolate</span></code> function. The original implementation was using custom code for spatial indexing, which was replaced by a performant vectorised implementation based on the more recent <a class="reference external" href="https://pygeos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pygeos</span></code></a> project.</p>
<p>With sample data, we’ve been able to speed up the interpolation from 2.4 seconds to less than 400 milliseconds, having the same result 6x faster.</p>
<p>Such an improvement is great, but it still uses only a single core (as most of the geospatial code to be honest), leaving the rest in a modern computer (four or more cores is not uncommon these days…) lazily laying around. We have tried to change this and contributed a (still experimental) parallel implementation of the same algorithm (based on <a class="reference external" href="https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">joblib</span></code></a>).</p>

<li><p>23 November - <a class="reference internal" href="blog/post5_mapchallenge.html">30DayMapChallenge 2020</a></p>
<p>On November 1<sup>st</sup> Topi Tjukanov <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/tjukanov/status/1311568912950140930">started</a> a <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/30DayMapChallenge">#30DayMapChallenge 2020</a> - one day, one map, one theme. Because it is a lot of fun, the Geographic Data Science Lab wanted to be a part of it and on 23<sup>rd</sup> day, it was our turn.</p>
<p>Since the topic was <em>boundaries</em>, we decided to share with you the process of creation of boundaries of morpohlogical tessellation - the (smallest) spatial unit used in urban morphometrics.</p>
<p>Five cities, five different urban patterns. Morphological tessellation is in principle Voronoi tessellation based on building footprint polygons. In practice, we first shrink our polygons (you need a gap between adjacent buildings) by a small margin, then generate a dense array of points along the polygon boundary which is passed to Voronoi algorithm. Finally, resulting polygons are dissolved based on the building it belongs to, and morphological tessellation is done. See by yourself how each step looks and compares across different patterns on a matrix below. If you click on the image, you can see the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/urbangrammarai/urbangrammarai.github.io/blob/mapchallenge/src/notebooks/mapchallenge/matrix_lowres.png?raw=true">full resolution (16.2 MB)</a>.</p>
<p>Do you want to play with the algorithm and create your own sequences? We have a <a class="reference external" href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/urbangrammarai/urbangrammarai.github.io/blob/mapchallenge/src/notebooks/mapchallenge/tessellation.ipynb">notebook</a> just for you! And if you’re going to generate tessellation on your data, <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.momepy.org/en/stable/user_guide/elements/tessellation.html"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">momepy</span></code></a> has you covered. For further details head to Martin’s blog post about <a class="reference external" href="https://martinfleischmann.net/morphological-tessellation/">a paper on tessellation</a> he has published earlier this year.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for new advances in this space!</p>

<li><p>02 November - <a class="reference internal" href="blog/post4.html">Implementing morphological functions to the ecosystem</a></p>
<p>This blog post covers some of the efforts the team has made to contribute code developed for the project to the broader Python eco-system for (geographic) data science. Processing of data within <a class="reference external" href="https://urbangrammarai.github.io/data_processing/index">WP1</a> and morphometric assessment within <a class="reference external" href="https://urbangrammarai.github.io/spatial_signatures/index">WP2</a> entail the development of new bespoke algorithms and implementation of some which are currently available in the Python ecosystem. However, even those already existing were often not performant enough for the scale of this project.</p>
<p>As part of the data processing stage of the project, we have refactored some of them to gain the performance enhancements we needed. Since we strongly believe in replicability of research, all software developed within Urban Grammar AI project should be available for other researchers, optimally packaged in a friendly shape of a Python library. At the same time, we want to support open-source software which we use for the research.</p>
<p>We think the natural approach is to include enhancements made within the area of urban morphometrics to <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.momepy.org"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">momepy</span></code></a> an existing toolkit for urban morphology. <a class="reference external" href="https://urbangrammarai.github.io/spatial_signatures/index">WP2</a> heavily builds on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">momepy</span></code>’s code and every relevant piece of code we made is now merged back into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">momepy</span></code>. That covers both performance-focused changes to implementation (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/martinfleis/momepy/pull/219">#219</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/martinfleis/momepy/pull/209">#209</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/martinfleis/momepy/pull/207">#207</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/martinfleis/momepy/pull/205">#205</a>), mostly based on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pygeos</span></code> and vectorization, and new additions.</p>
<p>Two key features of Spatial Signatures, the concepts of <a class="reference external" href="https://urbangrammarai.github.io/spatial_signatures/spatial_unit/Parallelized_enclosures.html">enclosures</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://urbangrammarai.github.io/spatial_signatures/spatial_unit/enclosed_tessellation.html">enclosed tessellation</a> are now available in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">momepy.elements</span></code> module and you can create both using only a few lines of code:</p>
<p>See the detailed guidance in <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.momepy.org/en/latest/user_guide/elements/enclosed.html">momepy’s documentation</a>.</p>

<li><p>01 October - <a class="reference internal" href="blog/post3.html">First Advisory Board</a></p>
<p>On October 1st. 2020, Dani and Martin held the first meeting of the Advisory Board for the project. We are thrilled to have a board that includes <a class="reference external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardes/">Alistair Edwardes</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/curds/people/staffprofile/rachelfranklin.html#background">Rachel Franklin</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/izzysargent">Isabel Sargent</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dpi.inpe.br/DPI/institucional/pessoal/servidores/antonio-miguel-vieira-monteiro">Antonio Miguel Vieira Monteiro</a>.</p>
<p>The meeting took place, as it’s become customary in 2020, on Zoom. Dani provided an overview of the main components of the project, and Martin updated on progress so far; throughout the three hours of the meeting, there was plenty of discussion and great questions about what the project is trying to do and how it’ll tackle its main challenges. This is by no means a full replacement of the physical meeting we would have had in Liverpool for a full day, but it was an excellent way to connect and kickstart the role of the Advisory Board.</p>
<p>One of the conclusions from the discussion was that we might adapt to the current situation by trying to have these meetings a bit more frequent (initially only four were scheduled for the entire project) and of shorter duration than a full day (maybe up to three hours). This will allow us to focus on specific aspects of the project for every meeting. Next one will hopefully take place early in the next year and, by then, we might even have something in the form of deliverables to show!</p>

<li><p>01 July - <a class="reference internal" href="blog/post2.html">Welcome to Martin Fleischmann</a></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/urbangrammarai/urbangrammarai.github.io/blob/master/src/_static/martin.jpg?raw=true" alt="Martin Fleischmann" class="bg-primary" width="200px" style="float:left;margin-right: 10px;"> The project is thrilled to welcome Martin Fleischmann as the postdoctoral researcher who will work with me (Dani) for the next two years of the Fellowship. Here is a quick bio of Martin:</p>
<p>Martin Fleischmann is research associate in the Geographic Data Science Lab at the University of Liverpool and a member of the Urban Design Studies Unit at the University of Strathclyde. His research focuses on urban morphology and geographic data science focusing on quantitative analysis and classification of urban form, remote sensing and AI.</p>
<p>He is the author of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">momepy</span></code>, the open source urban morphology measuring toolkit for Python and member of development teams of GeoPandas, the open source Python package for geographic data and PySAL, the Python library for spatial analysis.</p>
<p>Martin brings with him a theoretical background in urban morphology combined with a <em>lot</em> of experience in Python open source development around geospatial. There could not be a better combination for the project. As the postdoctoral researcher, Martin will be heavily involved in the implementation of much of the code required to develop the idea of Spatial Signatures, teach a computer to recognise them from satellite imagery, and use them to develop an Urban Grammar. At the same time, he is also joining the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geographic-data-science/">Geographic Data Science Lab</a> and getting involved in its day to day life, participating in internal seminars, coordinating the Brown Bags series and, more generally, chipping in where possible to make the lab a great place to be part of.</p>
<p>Welcome Martin, this will be a fun ride!</p>
