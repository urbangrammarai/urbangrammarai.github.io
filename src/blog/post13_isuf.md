# Form-based Signatures at ISUF 2021

On June 30th, Martin presented a classification of Great Britain based on the form
component of Spatial Signatures at the International Seminar on Urban Form 2021, which
was held virtually in Glasgow, Scotland. This was the first time we have presented results covering the
whole GB, albeit using a single component only (function has been temporarily excluded). The work was received positively and spurred
a bit of discussion. Within a few months, the results should be published in the conference proceedings.
