# Signatures for (all of) GB at Turing Urban Analytics

On June 30th, Dani provided an overview of ongoing work to build Spatial Signatures for all 
of Great Britain at the Turing's [Urban Analytics monthly meetup](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/urban-analytics-monthly-meet).
This was the first public presentation covering our work at a national scale and we are excited at how positively it was
received.

The talk is published now on YouTube:
