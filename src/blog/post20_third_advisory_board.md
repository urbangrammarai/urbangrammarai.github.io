# Third Advisory Board

On December 9th. 2021, we held the the meeting of the Advisory Board for the project. Still being limited by the global pandemic, we had a frutiful Zoom call filled with an exciting discussion on the opportunities Spatial Signatures offer.

The session started with an overview of the current progress focusing on the current progress and explanation of the whole process of generating spatial signatures from data acquistion to empirical exploration. We then spent
some time discussed the open infrastruture built around the project resulitng in an open data product and maximum transparency of the process behind it. We followed by the focused discussion on dissemination and impact of the classification.

Three hours later, we finished with a lot of ideas and potential research avenues and collaborations to be explored. We hope that the situation permits another Advisory board meeting soon and hopefully, in person.
