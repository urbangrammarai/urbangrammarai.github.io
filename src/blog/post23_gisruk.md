# GISRUK talk

On April 7th, we had a chance to attend the first large in-person academic conference
since the project started more than two years ago. Martin joined GISRUK, coincidentally
organised by the Geographic Data Science Lab, and presented ongoing work on developing
an AI model to detect spatial signatures based on satellite imagery. The talk focused on
the progress we have made so far and specifically on geographical questions arising when
we try to link granular geometry of signatures to satellite images and rectangular chips
sampled from them.

We have received good feedback and suggestions for the next steps we are currently
trying to implement in our plans. For anyone interested, the slides presented during the
conference are available
[here](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/202204_gisruk/index.html) or as a [PDF (33MB)
here](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/202204_gisruk/index.pdf). The extended abstract
of the talk is also available in [the conference
proceedings](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6411620).
