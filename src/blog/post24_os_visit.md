# OS visit

On May 17th and 18th, Martin and Dani spent a week visiting the Ordnance
Survey in Southampton. The trip was planned as an institutional visit to
exchange ideas, discuss the project and, more generally, interact with our
advisory board member, Dr. Isabel Sargent and her team at OS Research.

We had a fantastic time. We presented our current work on using computer
vision, a bit of geographic magic, and satellite imagery to automate the
recognition of our upcoming spatial signatures for Great Britain. You can
check out the slides we used for that presentation in our usual [talks
repository](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/) in our two common formats:

- [`HTML`](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/202205_OS/index.html) for the
  browser
- [`PDF`](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/202205_OS/index.pdf) for download

Beyond the purely scheduled, we had the oportunity to see OS from the inside
and to chat to a lot of really clever people about our project, its value, and
potential solutions to the challenges we're currently facing.

We had so much fun, in fact, we could not skip the de-rigueur selfie:
