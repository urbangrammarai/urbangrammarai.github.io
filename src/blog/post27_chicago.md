# Chicago visit

The first week of May, Dani visited the University of Chicago. As part of the
trip, he (re-)connected with folks at the [Center for Spatial Data Science]()
and met a bunch of new friends at the [Mansueto Institute for Urban
Innovation](). All in all, it was a fantastic week where there was even a bit
of time to discuss all things urban form and function.

On May 4th, he delivered the lecture "'Open by Default' - Developing
reproducible, computational research" on open workflows for modern
computational research at one of the GIS courses offered at Chicago and
taught by Dr. Marynia Kolak. The
slides of the talk are available at the Urban Grammar's [talks
repository](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/) in our two common formats:

- [`HTML`](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/202205_uc/index.html) for the
  browser
- [`PDF`](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/202205_uc/index.pdf) for download

This was a particularly tricky talk to conceive and prepare. Conceptually, it
was a bit out of our "comfort zone" in that it is not really about the
research we are doing at the Urban Grammar, but about the _process_ we follow
to realize it. It was also hard to structure it in a way that made sense because
it pulled from many different aspects of the project, from the approach we
take to writing slide decks to the computational infrastructure on which all
of our computations rely. We are nevertheless happy with the outcome. It's not
ideal, and we will probably refine it in successive iterations (we're planning
on giving similar talks in the near future, stay tuned!), but this is a great
start.
