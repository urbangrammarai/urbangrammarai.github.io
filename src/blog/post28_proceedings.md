# Form-based Signatures paper and data

Last year, [we attended](post13_isuf) the International Seminar on Urban Form 2021,
which was held virtually in Glasgow, Scotland and presented a classification of Great
Britain based on the form component of Spatial Signatures. Earlier this year the
proceedings from the conference were published, including our paper describing the work.
On that occasion, we also published the dataset of resulting morphosignatures.

You can get the paper either from the original proceedings under DOI
[10.17868/strath.00080527](https://doi.org/10.17868/strath.00080527) or from our [Github
repository](https://github.com/urbangrammarai/isuf21_paper/raw/main/isuf_paper.pdf)
(8MB). The bibtex citation for the paper is attached below.

The dataset is available from XXX and contains YYY.
