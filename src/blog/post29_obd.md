# *"Open by Default" talk at the RSS

Last month, Dani participated in the "Using open data sources" event put
together by the lovely folks at the [Merseyside chapter of the RSS](https://rss.org.uk/merseyside/)
and [HiPy](https://twitter.com/hipyliv). There, he delivered the talk "Open by
default - Developing reproducible, computational research". You can find the
slides on the [usual place](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/) (or
[here](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/202206_rss_merseyside/index.html)
and in [PDF[(https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/202206_rss_merseyside/index.pdf) directly).
The video is also available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3hYWLYApoA&t=3531s):

This was a similar, albeit refined, talk to the one he did in [Chicago](post27_chicago) and it is great
it is now available to watch online.
