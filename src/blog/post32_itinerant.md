# The Spatial Signatures on ITINERANT

Dani and Martin participated earlier this month in the stakeholder engagement workshop organised by the ITINERANT project. This was an event where the project presented final results to a series of stakeholders including the ONS Data Science Campus, the Liverpool City Region, or the UK 2070 Commission. The event was held in Liverpool but streamed online and the talks are available on YouTube now (Spatial Signatures starting at [minute 23](https://youtu.be/lhyytz7ayTY?t=1412)).
