# AAG'23 presentation

On March 26th, Dani presented ongoing work at the AAG'23 conference. The talk was part of the Urban Analytics sessions co-organised between the Alan Turing Institute, Liverpool and Leeds, and focused on progress on using deep learning to predict spatial signatures from satellite imagery. As usual, you can find the slides in the [talks page](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/), both in [HTML](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/202303_aag/index.html) and [PDF](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/202303_aag/index.pdf) versions.
