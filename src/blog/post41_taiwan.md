# Participation in Taiwanese forum

On April 12th, Dani participated as online speaker in an event organised by the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in Taiwan. The event, named “Masters Gathering”, and organised for the National Science and Technology Council of Taiwan Government focused on artificial intelligence in the smart city. Dani provided an overview of the Urban Grammar to the audience. Sadly, he was not able to participate live due to illness, but managed to record a short video with the presentation. You can check out the slides he used in the [talks page](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/), both in [HTML](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/20230412_taiwan/index.html) and [PDF](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/talks/20230412_taiwan/index.pdf) format.
