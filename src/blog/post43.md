# Clustergram published in the JOSS

The Python package Clustergram, developed in the early stage of this project, has now a software paper published in the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS). 

In 2021, we have developed a small package for visualisation and diagnostic of cluster analysis to help us understand various clustering solutions when delineating spatial signatures. You can see the original post [here](post10_clustergram). The package was furhter improved over the years and was recently published in the JOSS.
