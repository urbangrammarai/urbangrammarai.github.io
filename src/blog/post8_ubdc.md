# Spatial Signatures at UBDC

On March 16th, Dani presented ongoing work on the development of Spatial
Signatures at the University of Glasgow's Urban Big Data Centre webinar
series. This was the first time we took the project on tour and it was very
well received. With an audience that peaked at about 75 folks and many great
questions that extended the session well over one hour, we are super happy
with how the foundational ideas of the project were received.

The link to the webinar, for posterity, is [here](http://ubdc.ac.uk/education-and-events/events-and-courses/past-events-2021/spatial-signatures-research-webinar/) and
