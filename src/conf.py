# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.
#
# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full
# list see the documentation:
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
# import os
# import sys
# sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))
import ablog


# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

project = 'Urban Grammar AI'
copyright = '2020, Dani Arribas-Bel, Martin Fleischmann'
author = 'Dani Arribas-Bel, Martin Fleischmann'

# -- General ABlog Options ----------------------------------------------------

# A path relative to the configuration directory for blog archive pages.
#blog_path = 'blog'

# The "title" for the blog, used in active pages.  Default is ``'Blog'``.
blog_title = u'Urban Grammar AI Blog'

# Base URL for the website, required for generating feeds.
# e.g. blog_baseurl = "http://example.com/"
blog_baseurl = u'https://urbangrammarai.github.io/'

# Choose to archive only post titles. Archiving only titles can speed
# up project building.
#blog_archive_titles = False

# -- Blog Authors, Languages, and Locations -----------------------------------

# A dictionary of author names mapping to author full display names and
# links. Dictionary keys are what should be used in ``post`` directive
# to refer to the author.  Default is ``{}``.
blog_authors = {}


# A dictionary of language code names mapping to full display names and
# links of these languages. Similar to :confval:`blog_authors`, dictionary
# keys should be used in ``post`` directive to refer to the locations.
# Default is ``{}``.
#blog_languages = {
#    'en': ('English', None),
#}


# A dictionary of location names mapping to full display names and
# links of these locations. Similar to :confval:`blog_authors`, dictionary
# keys should be used in ``post`` directive to refer to the locations.
# Default is ``{}``.
#blog_locations = {
#    'Earth': ('The Blue Planet', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth),

# -- Blog Post Related --------------------------------------------------------

# Format date for a post.
#post_date_format = '%b %d, %Y'

# Number of paragraphs (default is ``1``) that will be displayed as an excerpt
# from the post. Setting this ``0`` will result in displaying no post excerpt
# in archive pages.  This option can be set on a per post basis using
#post_auto_excerpt = 1

# Index of the image that will be displayed in the excerpt of the post.
# Default is ``0``, meaning no image.  Setting this to ``1`` will include
# the first image, when available, to the excerpt.  This option can be set
# on a per post basis using :rst:dir:`post` directive option ``image``.
#post_auto_image = 0

# Number of seconds (default is ``5``) that a redirect page waits before
# refreshing the page to redirect to the post.
#post_redirect_refresh = 5

# When ``True``, post title and excerpt is always taken from the section that
# contains the :rst:dir:`post` directive, instead of the document. This is the
# behavior when :rst:dir:`post` is used multiple times in a document. Default
# is ``False``.
#post_always_section = False

# When ``False``, the :rst:dir:`orphan` directive is not automatically set
# for each post. Without this directive, Sphinx will warn about posts that
# are not explicitly referenced via another document. :rst:dir:`orphan` can
# be set on a per-post basis as well if this is false. Default is ``True``.
#post_auto_orphan = True

# -- ABlog Sidebars -------------------------------------------------------

# There are seven sidebars you can include in your HTML output.
# postcard.html provides information regarding the current post.
# recentposts.html lists most recent five posts. Others provide

#     }

# -- Blog Feed Options --------------------------------------------------------

# Turn feeds by setting :confval:`blog_baseurl` configuration variable.

# -- Font-Awesome Options -----------------------------------------------------

# ABlog templates will use of Font Awesome icons if one of the following
# is ``True``

# Link to `Font Awesome`_ at `Bootstrap CDN`_ and use icons in sidebars
# and post footers.  Default: ``None``

# Alternatively, you can provide the path to `Font Awesome`_ :file:`.css`
# with the configuration option: fontawesome_css_file
# Path to `Font Awesome`_ :file:`.css` (default is ``None``) that will
# be linked to in HTML output by ABlog.

# -- Disqus Integration -------------------------------------------------------

# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
